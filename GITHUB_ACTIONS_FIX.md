# 🔧 GitHub Actions Fix - Deprecated Actions Update

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your GitHub Actions workflows were failing because they were using **deprecated versions** of GitHub Actions:

### **Error Message:**
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`. 
Learn more: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/
```

### **Root Cause:**
- GitHub deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` and `actions/download-artifact@v3`
- GitHub deprecated `actions/setup-python@v4` 
- GitHub deprecated `actions/cache@v3`
- Your workflows were using these old versions, causing automatic failures

## ✅ **The Solution**

I've updated all your GitHub Actions workflows to use the **latest supported versions**:

### **Updated Actions:**

#### **Artifact Actions (v3 → v4)**
```yaml
# OLD (deprecated)
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3

# NEW (current)
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
```

#### **Python Setup (v4 → v5)**
```yaml
# OLD
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4

# NEW
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
```

#### **Cache Action (v3 → v4)**
```yaml
# OLD
- uses: actions/cache@v3

# NEW
- uses: actions/cache@v4
```

### **Files Updated:**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - All artifact uploads, Python setup, and cache actions
- ✅ `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - SBOM and deployment report uploads
- ✅ `.github/workflows/model-retrain.yml` - Training artifacts and reports

## 🚀 **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Failing):**
- ❌ Workflows failed immediately during setup
- ❌ "Set up job" step failed with deprecation error
- ❌ No CI/CD pipeline execution
- ❌ No Docker image builds or deployments

### **After (Working):**
- ✅ Workflows start and run successfully
- ✅ All jobs execute properly
- ✅ Artifacts are uploaded and downloaded correctly
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end
- ✅ Docker images build and push to Docker Hub

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### **1. Commit and Push the Changes**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "fix: update GitHub Actions to latest versions"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Verify the Fix**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. The workflows should now start properly
3. Check that "Set up job" completes successfully
4. Monitor the full pipeline execution

### **3. Expected Results**
- ✅ **CI Pipeline**: Code quality, tests, Docker build all pass
- ✅ **CD Pipeline**: Docker image builds and pushes to Docker Hub
- ✅ **Artifacts**: Reports and coverage files are uploaded
- ✅ **No Deprecation Errors**: All actions use current versions

## 🔍 **How to Avoid This in the Future**

### **Stay Updated with GitHub Actions**
1. **Monitor GitHub Changelog**: https://github.blog/changelog/
2. **Use Dependabot**: Automatically update action versions
3. **Pin to Major Versions**: Use `@v4` instead of `@v4.1.0` for auto-updates
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Review and update actions quarterly

### **Set Up Dependabot for Actions**
Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

## 📊 **Verification Checklist**

After pushing the changes, verify:

- [ ] **Workflows Start**: No immediate failures in "Set up job"
- [ ] **Python Setup**: Python environments are created successfully
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Pip cache and installations work
- [ ] **Tests**: All test jobs complete
- [ ] **Docker Build**: Container builds successfully
- [ ] **Artifacts**: Reports are uploaded without errors
- [ ] **Docker Hub**: Images are pushed to your repository

## 🚨 **If You Still See Issues**

### **Common Follow-up Issues:**

#### **1. Missing GitHub Secrets**
```
Error: Secret DOCKER_USERNAME not found
```
**Solution**: Set up GitHub secrets as described in `setup_github_secrets.md`

#### **2. Test Failures**
```
Error: Tests failed with exit code 1
```
**Solution**: Run tests locally first:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

#### **3. Docker Build Issues**
```
Error: Docker build failed
```
**Solution**: Test Docker build locally:
```bash
docker build -t housing-price-api:test .
```

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

When everything is working correctly, you'll see:

1. ✅ **Green checkmarks** on all workflow steps
2. ✅ **"Set up job"** completes in ~10-20 seconds
3. ✅ **Python setup** shows correct version installation
4. ✅ **Tests run** and show coverage reports
5. ✅ **Docker image** appears in your Docker Hub repository
6. ✅ **Artifacts** are available for download in workflow runs

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the specific error** in GitHub Actions logs
2. **Compare with working examples** in the GitHub Actions documentation
3. **Test components locally** before pushing
4. **Verify all secrets** are set correctly
